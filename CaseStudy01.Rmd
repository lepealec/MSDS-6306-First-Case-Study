When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
##Loading In data file Beers.csv 
Beers <- read.csv('Beers.csv',header = T,sep = ",")

## Loading in data file Breweries.csv. File contains information about Brewerey's Name, Unique ID number, City and State of Headquarters
Brew <- read.csv('Breweries.csv',header = T,sep = ",")
colnames(Brew) <- c("Brewery_id","Brewery Name","City","State")
head(Brew)
```

## 1. How many breweries are present in each state? 


```{r}
library(dplyr)
state_counts <- Brew %>%
                 group_by(State) %>%
                 summarise(count=n())
state_counts <-arrange(state_counts, desc(count))                    
head(state_counts)


```

* **The 3 states with the most breweries are CO(47), CA(39) & MI(32)**



## 2. Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file

```{r}
# Merge the 2 data sets
BrewMerged <- merge(Brew,Beers, by="Brewery_id",all=TRUE)
head(BrewMerged,6)
tail(BrewMerged,6)
```

## 3. Report the number of NA's in each column. 
```{r}
sapply(BrewMerged, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```
* **As you can see only 2 columns hae NA values(ABV with 62 & IBU with 1005)**

## 4. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
Medians <- aggregate(cbind(BrewMerged$ABV,BrewMerged$IBU)~State,FUN = median,BrewMerged,na.rm=TRUE)
colnames(Medians) <- c("State","ABV","IBU")
Medians

ggplot(data=Medians,aes(State, y = ABV, fill=ABV))+geom_bar(stat = "identity")+labs(x = "State" , y = "ABV") + ggtitle("ABV median per State")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),axis.text.y=element_text(size=5) )

ggplot(data=Medians,aes(State, y = IBU, fill=IBU))+geom_bar(stat = "identity")+labs(x = "State" , y = "IBU") + ggtitle("IBU median per State")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),axis.text.y=element_text(size=5) )
```



## 5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer

```{r}
BrewMerged[which.max(BrewMerged$ABV),]
BrewMerged[which.max(BrewMerged$IBU),]

```
* **Upslope Brewing Company has the highest ABV count of 0.128**
* **Astoria Brewing company has the hightest IBU of 138**

## 6. Summary statistics for the ABV variable.
```{r}
statistics <- summary(BrewMerged$ABV)
statistics


```



## 7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot. 

```{r}
# To draw scatterplot to find the relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content:
ggplot(BrewMerged,aes(x = ABV,y = IBU ))+geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)+geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE, na.rm=TRUE)


```
